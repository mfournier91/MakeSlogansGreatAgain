1. I want to click on a 'generate political slogan' button and get back "make [noun] [adjective] again" where the nouns and adjectives are random. -bronze
2. I want a funny random background image each time I click the button of things that look like Trump. -silver
3. I want a tweet this button, which redirects to my twitter with the tweet field populated with the random slogan. -gold

Steps for bronze: Create a rails api. Add CORS. Make a static react app with a button. Make the buttons onClick perform a get request to the api.
